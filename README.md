Book Recommendation System using Tkinter GUI

Overview:
This Python program creates a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter library for recommending books based on user-selected genres. It allows users to choose up to three genres from a dropdown menu and provides recommendations of books from those genres.

Features:

    Genre Selection: Users can select up to three genres from a dropdown menu.
    Recommendation: After selecting genres, users can click on the "Recommend Books" button to get recommendations based on their selected genres.
    Random Selection: The program randomly selects three unique books from the selected genres and displays them as recommendations.
    Styling: The GUI elements are styled using ttk styles to provide a visually appealing interface.

Files:

    LibRecV2.py: Python script containing the main code for the book recommendation system.
    librarybooks.png: Background image used in the GUI.

Usage:

    Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    Run the  LibRecV2.py script.
    Select up to three genres from the dropdown menus.
    Click on the "Recommend Books" button to get recommendations.

Dependencies:

    Python 3.x
    Tkinter (should be available by default with Python installation)

Customization:

    You can modify the genre_books dictionary to add more books and authors or change existing ones.
    The background image (librarybooks.png) can be replaced with another image of your choice, just ensure to update the file path in the script accordingly.
    Styling attributes such as colors, fonts, and sizes can be adjusted in the code.

Note:

    This program assumes that users have basic knowledge of Python and Tkinter library to understand and customize the code.
    Ensure to provide appropriate file paths if the directory structure is changed or if using different images.


Vers3-Vers4. Code was updated in version 4 to add a check out and return function for the books.
